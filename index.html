<b><p> Why sould I buy this product?<p/></b>
<p>The reason you should buy this product is because you never realize how much you need this product until something happens. Being in an area with little to no signal or using a phone until the battery dies complicates life.</p>
<br>
<b><p> Does it come with a case?</p></b>
<p>No, it does not come with a case yet. Once we have secured our place in the market we will introduce cases, waterproof abilities, and possibly having the device bounce back in dropped.</p>
<br>
<b><p> Does your product come in different colors?</p></b>
<p>Yes, it does because we know how picky people are. It comes in Red, Blue, Black, Pink and Green</p>
<br>
<b><p>Can you customize it?</p></b>
<p> As of right now you cannot customize it, but as we progress as a company we will have cases.
<br>
<b><p>Do we offer warranty?</p></b>
<p> Yes we do we offer warranty for three months </p>
	 <br>
	 <b><p>How does it work and do I need to pay for the hotspot?</p></b>
	 <p>It is a wireless router that connect to multiple signals and there are no additional fees after you puchase the product.</p>
		 <br>
	 <b><p>When is the product being launched?
